\begin{abstract}
In this paper we \textcolor{red}{explain-propose} a possible machine-learning approach for the enhanced inter-cell interference coordination (eICIC) in a heterogeneous network (HetNet), where macro and micro cells optimize their downlink transmission in a self-adaptive manner. The idea is to exploit the Q-learning algorithm to guarantee a fair resource sharing between micro and macro cells and so to make the system works in the best performance possible. Indeed this specific reinforcement learning technique is used to find out the optimal policy that leads to the right ABS pattern setting, designed specifically for each scenario. Hence evaluating only a few parameters and changing dynamically the ABS pattern we aim to cope the possible alterations on the environment.\\

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The great spreading of mobile devices all over the world represents the fastest adoption of any technology that
our society has ever experienced, faster than the Internet and the earlier generations of mobile
communications. Now tablets, android devices, iPhones, application stores, social media and the data
exchanges between end-users and clouds are all growing at exponential speed. Providing the necessary bandwidth and capacity to the people so they can keep the pace of this growth is a fascinating challenge; then in order to achieve that, a more network densification is required together a full exploitation of the simultaneous presence of micro (coverage radius around 10m-300m) and macro (coverage radius up to 20km) cells, the so called heterogeneous networks (HetNet).\\
\textcolor{red}{add statistics and forecast of mobile traffic}
The only way these challenges can be cost-effective, efficient and human-handleable is through the use of more automated and autonomous systems, such as Self-Organizing Networks (SON): the goal is to minimize the human intervention in the planning, deployment, optimization and maintenance activities of these new networks.\\
A such SON conceptually must own, as explained by \cite{ramiro2011self}, the following capabilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Self-Planning: process of identifying the parameter settings of new network elements (like radio parameters of a new eNodeB or a table of neighbor nodes);
\item Self-Deployment: preparation, installation, authentication and delivery of a status report of
a new network node in order to get a "plug and play" approach for each new device;
\item Self-Healing: execution of the routine actions that keep the network operational and/or
prevent problems (this includes the necessary software and hardware upgrades);
\item Self-Optimization is defined as the utilization of measurements and performance indicators
collected by the User Equipments (UEs) and the base stations in order to auto-tune the network
settings.
\end{itemize}
Our work is focused on the last point of the list, more precisely on the improvement of the signal quality and consequently the throughput in a LTE system, trying to minimize the interference between micro and macro cell with an adaptive coordination in downlink transmissions of the antennas (mainly controlling the transmit power patterns).\\
The problem we're facing consists in discovering an optimal trade-off of the radio resources to be assigned between high-power nodes (macro) and low-power nodes (micro). The latter has an higher capacity and consequently an user connected to it will benefit of a better performance, however due to fact that it shares the same frequency band with the macros, low-power nodes are severely affected by the interference from the high-power nodes. In other words, downlink micro transmissions to its UEs could be sorely degraded by high power macro transmission; besides UEs that are close to a micro could end up associating to a macro due to the higher power strength received from the stronger node.\\
So the issue is that, accounting the above scenarios, the micro could be left underutilized and this would turn out to be a bad exploitation of the resources deployed appositely to enhance the connectivity in some areas, with a following shortage of the user performance in comparison with achievable potential capacity.\\
Addressing a fair resource sharing, a solution could be stop macros from all the transmissions (some exception signals, like beacons, are always active), for a certain amount of time: this approach is adopted by LTE 3GPP standard and is known as enhanced Inter Cell Interference Coordination (eICIC). The period in which macros are "silent" is called Almost Blank Subframe (ABS), period over which micros can transmit with reduced interference.\\
Time is slotted in frames of 10 ms and each one of these is split into 10 subframes, so a macro decides to mute itself in a certain subframe following the ABS mask, that's the pattern of 0's and 1's where 1 indicates the macro's inactivity.\\
The goal is to discover an adaptive ABS mask that maximizes the UEs' performance and it's found as the result of an optimization problem. Our idea is to exploit a reinforcement learning (RL) approach, the so called Q-learning technique in order to reach the fairness between the shared resources and set the best ABS mask in a self-tuning manner for each specific scenario.\\
Thanks to the LTE environment simulator MONSTeR (MObile Networks SimulaToR) \cite{monster}, a framework built around the LTE system toolbox available in Matlab, we simulate a great amount of data traffic with the purpose of training the Q-learning: after this period the method involved will yield the best policy for setting the considered mask.

\section{Related Work}\label{sec:sota}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this section we will overview the main proposals in the literature.\\
First of all we must take in account the solution exposed in \cite{deb2014algorithms} to protect the downlink micro transmissions. Alongside the concept of ABS period they introduced the so called Flexible User Association and Cell selection bias (CSB). As we already know, whenever a UE needs to select a suitable cell for association it chooses the one with the strongest signal and therefore the utilization of the micro mostly of time is neglected.\\
LTE has introduced the bias value $\alpha_i$, that is broadcasted to all the UEs. Hence the UE will choose the right cell maximizing the sum between $\alpha_i$ and the received signal power $P_i$ over each i-th cell in the system; obviously higher bias values are assigned to the micros.\\
The authors of \cite{deb2014algorithms} proposed two algorithms, one for the optimal ABS mask (OPT-ABS) and one for defining the right value for the CBS. The former is split into two parts: the first to search the number of optimal subframes in which the macros are mute and second how to define the optimal ABS pattern. This algorithm turned up to be a NP-hard computational problem, however they proofed that with a cleaver breakdown in some defined steps it's implementable and the complexity is scalar with number of cells. Instead the latter algorithm compute the biases so that the "association error" (as compared to optimal association) is minimized. This technique shows some shortcomings as the fact that is hardly applicable to a non-static scenario because the beforehand knowledge of the locations is required in order to evaluate which is the best cell in the area, information not always available.\\
Another noteworthy paper is surely \cite{simsek2013enhanced}, here the authors tried to put into practice a similar reinforcement learning approach. The state is made of two parameters, the Signal to Intererence Noise Ratio (SINR) for the player in relation with the macro and the micro, nevertheless these are not values that the eNodeB takes normally in account and we are aiming to use only the minimum number of information that are already exchanged, avoiding the loss of time due to computation for calculations (all the info exchanged between eNodeB and UE taken from the 3GPP release \cite{etsi2017136}).

\section{System Model}\label{sec:symo}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this section we will explain all the operative assumptions that we took in account for our proposal and the steps followed in our work.
\subsection{Problem modelization}
As stated in \cite{sutton1998reinforcement}, the main book about RL: the reinforcement learning problem is meant to be a straightforward framing of the problem of learning from interaction to achieve a goal. The learner, who is the one that makes the decisions is called the agent and in this scenario will be the macro. The thing it interacts with, comprising everything outside the agent, is called the environment, part played here by the simulator MONSTeR. These interact continually, the agent selecting actions and the environment responding to those actions and presenting new situations to the agent. The environment also yields rewards, numerical values that evaluate the goodness of the last action taken and that the agent tries to maximize over time. At each time step $t$, the agent receives a representation of the environment's state $S_t$, here defined by three parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item the ratio between the number of users in the macro and in the micro, quantized in four values which indicates if there're much more users in the macro, a little bit more in the macro, a little bit more in the micro or much more in the micro;
\item the ratio between the throughput of macro and mean value of all micros, also here quantized but in five values;
\item the number of ABS quantized in six values where each of them stays for the amount of 1's, always a multiple of 2, and those 1's are distributed in a certain pattern in the mask;    
\end{itemize}
so we assume that the total number of possible states in our environment is exactly $4\cdot 5\cdot 6=120$. Depending on which state the agent is, it selects an action $A_t$ from the set of all actions $A=\lbrace-2,0,2\rbrace$ that will modify the ABS mask by this amount.  The function reward selected for our system is 
\begin{equation*}
r(n^{m},n^{M},S^{m},S^{M})=-\bigg( \frac{n^{m}\cdot S^{M}}{n^{M} \cdot S^{m}}-1 \bigg) ^2
\end{equation*} 
where $m$ stands for micro and $M$ for macros and it shows the discrepancy between the actual system condition and the equilibrium we're aiming to. \\
At each time step, the agent maps from states to probabilities of taking each possible action. This mapping is called policy and is denoted as $\pi_t$. Reinforcement
learning specifies how the agent changes its policy in relation of its experience. The agent’s goal so is to maximize the total amount of reward it gains on the long term.
\subsection{Q-learning technique}
Q-learning algorithm was proposed by Watkins in \cite{watkins1992q} and consists in maintaining a table of estimated expected long-run reward, called indeed Q-values and written as $Q(S,A)  $, for each state-action couple. This technique is classified between the off-policy methods, in other words it evaluates or improves a policy different from that used to generate the data, as explained by \cite{sutton1998reinforcement}. So the idea to exploit two policies, one that is learned about and that becomes the optimal policy (target policy), and an exploratory one used to estimate the Q-values (exploration policy). Despite that the most used policies to implement the latter are the $\epsilon$-greedy or the softmax, we decided to use a totally random selection policy. \\
After Q-values have been enough discovered, the Q-learning function points out how to update the Q-value at each step and it's described as follows:
\begin{equation*}
Q(S_{t+1},A_{t+1})=Q(S_{t},A_{t})+\alpha[R(S_{t},A_{t})-Q(S_{t},A_{t})]
\end{equation*}
where $ R  $ is the maximized expected reward and $\alpha$ indicates with which rates we take actions towards the best Q-values achievable.
\subsection{Simulation settings}
In the simulations that have been put in place, the number of users was from 10 up to 25 randomly distributed between the cells (3 micros and a macro) and they move casually through a simulated urban scenario\footnote{Physical model adopted eHATA: Extended Okumura Hata model for path loss and MATLAB lteFading for fading.}  with a constant speed equals to 1 m/s. The packet generation from an user is modelled as a Possion process of rate $\lambda$ which is taken from a Gaussian distribution $\lambda \sim \mathcal{N}(10,5)$. So whenever a generation event occurs a packet file is created to be sent to the eNodeB with a certain probability inversely proportional to the size $\lbrace$\textcolor{red}{\textbf{to be defined}} $\rbrace$bit, i.e. the smallest packet will benefit of an higher likelihood due to the fact that we're simulating a realistic human behavior during a web surfing period.\\

\includegraphics[scale=0.68]{figures/traj.png}
\caption{Example of UEs in the urban simulated environment and highlighted trajectories; red dots represent the micros and the green the macro.} 
\end{figure}
After all these necessary premises, the first step is to run a big amount of simulations with the purpose of explore all the couples state-action, the Q-values, following the random policy and then the Q-learning will be applied to find out which will be the optimal policy to take. So at this point a several number of simulations with the standard ABS policy and with optimal one will be run to compare the results in terms of throughput (and delay?).
